Project for one of the biggest Russian banks. Participation in the outplacement project – providing employment for dismissed employees. Since the bank has a lot of branches across country, we had to analyze the local labor market – which jobs are available related to the bank sphere and salary rates. Then according to employees’ preferences (from the form they filled in) we could find a new place which suits them best. After we contacted employers – to suggest our candidates – and employees to show them possible options and, if needed, adjust our search. During than internship there were sent more than 200 vacancies to more than 90 organizations across Russia.
